            Difference
        </u>
    </h1>
    <center>
        <p>
            The basic difference between an alert box and an prompt box is that an alert box is used if we want that the
            information comes through to the user. A prompt box is used when we want the user to input a value before
            they access the page. In an alert box only a message is delivered to the user while in an prompt box along
            with an message the user has to input a value.
